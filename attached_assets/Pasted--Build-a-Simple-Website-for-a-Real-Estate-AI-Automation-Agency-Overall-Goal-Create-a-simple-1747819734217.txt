**Build a Simple Website for a Real Estate AI Automation Agency**

**Overall Goal:**
Create a simple, static website for an AI Automation Agency (AAA) specifically targeting real estate professionals. The website's primary purpose is to showcase how AI automation can solve the key pain points faced by agents and agencies, demonstrate tangible value, and build trust, based *only* on the information provided in the source texts. The website should be buildable using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, potentially simple JS).

**Target Audience:**
Real estate agents and agencies overwhelmed by administrative tasks and facing challenges with adopting new technology.

**Required Website Structure (Sections/Pages):**
The website should be structured into clear sections, potentially as a single-page site with navigation or multiple distinct pages, covering the following areas as identified in our previous discussion:

1.  **Homepage** (Focus: Core Value Proposition & Pain Point Address)
2.  **Solutions/Services** (Focus: Detailing Automation Capabilities)
3.  **Data Quality & Governance** (Focus: Building Confidence in Insights)
4.  **Data Privacy, Security & Compliance** (Focus: Building Trust regarding Data)
5.  **Implementation & Integration** (Focus: Easing Technical Hurdles - Can be "How It Works")
6.  **Workforce Adoption & Change Management** (Focus: Addressing Resistance & Human Element)
7.  **ROI Measurement & Articulation** (Focus: Demonstrating Tangible Value - Can be "Case Studies" or "Success Stories")
8.  **Managing Expectations & Addressing Limitations** (Focus: Transparency Builds Trust - Can be part of an FAQ or separate "Understanding AI" section)
9.  **About Us / Contact Us** (Focus: Building Rapport and Connection)
10. **Testimonials/Social Proof** (Focus: Countering Hesitation & Demonstrating Value - Can be integrated or a separate section)
11. **Legal & Ethical Considerations** (Focus: Demonstrating Responsibility - Can be a link to policies or a separate info page)

**Content Requirements for Each Section (Drawing from Sources):**

    *   **Approach:** Mention the importance of robust "data governance, quality, and ethics" frameworks [1, 1, 2, 2]. Note that achieving value requires "new technical capabilities and engineering effort" related to data [1, 2].

*   **4. Data Privacy, Security & Compliance:**
    *   **Concerns:** Directly address the heightened concern about handling "sensitive client data" [1, 2], potential "data breaches" [1-3], and compliance with regulations like **GDPR and CCPA** [1, 1, 2, 2].
